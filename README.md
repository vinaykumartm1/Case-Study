# McDonald's Customer Segmentation Analysis

This project analyzes a dataset of customer perceptions and behaviors related to McDonald's. It uses a combination of data preprocessing, dimensionality reduction (via Principal Component Analysis), and clustering techniques to identify distinct customer segments. The goal is to gain insights into different customer groups and their preferences.

## üöÄ About the Project

The core objective of this project is to uncover hidden patterns and groups within customer survey data. By using Python libraries for data manipulation and machine learning, the notebook demonstrates a complete workflow for:

- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** Transforming raw categorical survey responses into a format suitable for analysis.
- **Feature Engineering:** Identifying key attributes that influence customer behavior.
- **Customer Segmentation:** Applying advanced statistical techniques to group customers with similar preferences.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing the results to understand the characteristics of each customer segment.

### Features:

- **Data Preprocessing:** Converts "Yes/No" survey responses to a binary format for quantitative analysis.

- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):** Reduces the dimensionality of the survey data to identify the most significant underlying factors influencing customer choices.

- **Customer Clustering:** Segments customers into distinct groups based on their preferences, likely using a clustering algorithm like K-Means.

- **Data Visualization:** Generates plots to visualize the customer segments and their demographic profiles.
